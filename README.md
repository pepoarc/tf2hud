# tf2archhud

//RANT:
Being tired of the vanilla tf2 hud needing to
look to the furthest corners of my screen, I 
tried the usual huds from gamebanana. After 
using them for a while i forgot how stilized
and fitting for the game the vanilla is (how 
come) so i decided to do it myself.

//Description:
This hud tries to replicate the vanilla feel
of the style of the classic tf2 Hud and join
it with the more useful and easy to look at
huds that people usually make.
This is a begginers project, so its my first
hud adjusted for me and my gameplay. If 
something is missing, like mvm, streaks or 
something like that is because i dont care 
enough to touch it or i dont own it. :3
